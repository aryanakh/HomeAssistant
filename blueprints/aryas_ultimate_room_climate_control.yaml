    min_version: 2023.1.0
  description: >
    Reliable version:
    • Checks every 10 minutes (time_pattern)
    • Also reacts quickly if room temp changes by ≥0.8 °F (safe template trigger)
    • Adjustable multiplier for aggressiveness
    • Sets comfort range when in band
    • Debug logging in system logs
